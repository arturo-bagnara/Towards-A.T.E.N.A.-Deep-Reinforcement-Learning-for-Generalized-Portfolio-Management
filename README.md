# Towards A.T.E.N.A.: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Generalized Portfolio Management

The focus of my thesis was exploring how Deep Reinforcement Learning can be employed for the dynamic management of a portfolio of equities, using state-of-the-art Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, exploring different reward functions and network architectures. <br>
Due to the involvement of proprietary data owned by Wavenure SRL, I am unable to share the project's codebase publicly. However, this repository contains the comprehensive PDF of my thesis, which details: <br>
- The project's background and significance
- An overview of the methodologies employed
- A discussion on the findings and their implications
- Conclusions and recommendations for future work
